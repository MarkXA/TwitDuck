# TwitDuck

It's a TweetDeck web wrapper for Windows 10. It's open source.

Why? Because I needed a TweetDeck app for my PC and there wasn't one. And everything goes open source these days.

Anyway, feel free to admire a codebase that has all the complexity of left-pad (if left-pad used Reactive Extensions) and offer me a job as a result so I can turn it down because I'm not willing to relocate to San Francisco.

Alternatively, if you want to skip all that and just install it, head over to [the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/apps/twitduck/9nblggh1rj8b).

Love, Mark
